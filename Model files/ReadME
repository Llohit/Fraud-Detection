It's A Fruad .....

In this competition you are predicting whether an online transaction is fraudulent or not

Transaction Features:

TransactionDT: Timedelta from a given reference datetime (not an actual timestamp), but the time difference in seconds from a certain time.
TransactionAMT: Transaction payment amount in USD, the decimal part is worth paying attention to.
ProductCD: Product code, the product for each transaction. It may not necessarily be an actual product but may also refer to a service.
card1-card6: Payment card information, such as card type, card category, issue bank, country, etc.
addr1-addr2: Address, billing region and billing country
dist: Distances between (not limited) billing address, mailing address, zip code, IP address, phone area, etc.
P_ and (R__) emaildomain: Purchaser and recipient email domain, some transactions do not require the recipient, and the corresponding Remaildomain is empty
C1-C14: Counting, such as how many addresses are found to be associated with the payment card, etc.
D1-D15: Timedelta, such as days between previous transaction, etc.
M1-M9: Match, such as names on card and address, etc.
Vxxx: Vesta engineered rich features, including ranking, counting, and other entity relations. Some V features are missing in different proportions.
Identity Features:

id_01-id_11: Numerical features for identity, which is collected by Vesta and security partners such as device rating, ip_domain rating, proxy rating, etc. Also it recorded behavioral fingerprint like account login times/failed to login times, how long an account stayed on the page, etc.
DeviceType, DeviceInfo and id_12-id_38: Categorical Features

Step1: Preprocessing(Handling categorical features,Handling Null values,Outlier removal)
Step2:EDA
Step3:Training model(Logistic Regression,Random Forest,XGBoost,KNN,....)
Step4:Hyperparameter Tuning(Using Randomized Grid Search)
Step5:Try Multilayer Neural Network
